This repository contains my homework and learning note for MIT6.092.

The MIT public all lecture notes and assignements [in OpenCourseWare](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-092-introduction-to-programming-in-java-january-iap-2010/).

I have finished all assignments and shared them in the repository.

The lesson mainly focus on java grammer and basic programming technique.

I wrote what I learned from this lesson in view.txt.

Thanks to MIT and the course professors Evan Jones, Adam Marcus, and Eugene Wu for making this course publicly available on the Internet.
