This repo contains my homework and note for MIT6.092.

The MIT public all lecture notes and assignements [in OpenCourseWare](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-092-introduction-to-programming-in-java-january-iap-2010/).

I have finished all assignments and shore them in the repository.

The lesson mainly focus on java grammer and basic programming technique.

I also write what I learned from this lesson in view.txt.

Thanks for the devotion of MIT and class instructors.
